## Project Title
**Toronto TTC Bus Delay Report**

## Description
This project aims to analyze the delay time (in minutes) for various bus routes in Toronto and build a model to predict future delays based on explanatory variables, including:
- Day of the week
- Month
- Type of incident (if any)
- Minimum delay time recorded

We build a predictive model using historical bus data in 2024 to determine the likelihood and extent of delays for future bus operations.
